## üéØ Coding Standards

### C# (.NET Backend)

- Follow [Microsoft C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions)
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add XML documentation for public APIs
- Follow SOLID principles
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper error handling

**Example:**
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Gets a product by its unique identifier.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="id">The product identifier.</param>
/// <returns>The product if found, otherwise null.</returns>
public async Task<Product?> GetProductByIdAsync(int id)
{
    return await _context.Products
        .Include(p => p.ProductType)
        .Include(p => p.ProductBrand)
        .FirstOrDefaultAsync(p => p.Id == id);
}
```

### TypeScript/Angular (Frontend)

- Follow [Angular Style Guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide)
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Implement proper component lifecycle methods
- Use reactive forms over template-driven forms
- Follow the OnPush change detection strategy when possible
- Use async pipe in templates

**Example:**
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-product-list',
  templateUrl: './product-list.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./product-list.component.scss'],
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
export class ProductListComponent implements OnInit {
  products$ = this.productService.getProducts();

  constructor(
    private productService: ProductService,
    private cdr: ChangeDetectorRef
  ) {}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.loadProducts();
  }

  private loadProducts(): void {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

### General Guidelines

- Write clear, readable code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep functions and classes focused and small
- Remove unused code and imports
- Use version control effectively with clear commit messages

## üêõ Reporting Issues

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

**Backend Tests:**
```bash
cd API
dotnet test
```

**Frontend Tests:**
```bash
cd client
npm test
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Include integration tests for complex features
- Use meaningful test names that describe what is being tested
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies

**Example C# Test:**
```csharp
[Test]
public async Task GetProductByIdAsync_WithValidId_ReturnsProduct()
{
    // Arrange
    var productId = 1;
    var expectedProduct = new Product { Id = productId, Name = "Test Product" };
    
    // Act
    var result = await _repository.GetProductByIdAsync(productId);
    
    // Assert
    Assert.That(result, Is.Not.Null);
    Assert.That(result.Id, Is.EqualTo(productId));
}
```
