# Security Policy

## üîí Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of Skinet E-Commerce seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us responsibly.

### üìß How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send a detailed report to: **[klajdi.murataj@example.com]** (replace with actual email)

Include the following information in your report:

- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

### üïê Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 72 hours
- **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress at least every 5 business days
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 7 days

### üõ°Ô∏è Scope

This security policy applies to the following components:

#### In Scope
- **Main application**: The Skinet e-commerce platform
- **API endpoints**: All REST API endpoints
- **Authentication system**: JWT token handling and user authentication
- **Payment processing**: Stripe integration and payment flows
- **Database interactions**: Entity Framework Core queries and data handling
- **File uploads**: Any file upload functionality
- **Session management**: Redis-based session handling

#### Out of Scope
- **Third-party dependencies**: Vulnerabilities in external libraries (please report to respective maintainers)
- **Social engineering attacks**
- **Physical attacks**
- **Denial of Service (DoS) attacks**
- **Issues in development/test environments**

### üéØ Vulnerability Categories

We are particularly interested in:

#### High Priority
- **SQL Injection** vulnerabilities
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerabilities
- **Authentication bypass** vulnerabilities
- **Authorization flaws** (privilege escalation)
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** vulnerabilities
- **Payment processing** vulnerabilities
- **Sensitive data exposure**

#### Medium Priority
- **Information disclosure** vulnerabilities
- **Business logic** flaws
- **Session management** issues
- **Cryptographic** weaknesses

#### Lower Priority
- **Missing security headers** (if not exploitable)
- **Clickjacking** vulnerabilities
- **Open redirects** (if not exploitable)

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Measures

### Current Security Implementations

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT tokens** for stateless authentication
- **ASP.NET Core Identity** for user management
- **Role-based authorization** for different user types
- **Password hashing** using ASP.NET Core Identity defaults
- **Token expiration** and refresh mechanisms

#### Data Protection
- **Entity Framework Core** with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- **Input validation** using data annotations and model validation
- **HTTPS enforcement** for all communications
- **CORS policy** configuration
- **Sensitive data** excluded from client-side responses

#### Infrastructure Security
- **Redis** for secure session storage
- **Environment variables** for sensitive configuration
- **Database connection strings** secured
- **API rate limiting** (if implemented)

#### Frontend Security
- **Angular security best practices**
- **Content Security Policy** (if implemented)
- **XSS protection** through Angular's built-in sanitization
- **Secure HTTP communication** only

### üîß Recommended Security Practices

#### For Developers
1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **Output Encoding**: Properly encode outputs to prevent XSS
3. **Authentication**: Never skip authentication checks
4. **Authorization**: Implement proper authorization at every level
5. **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets to version control
6. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and monitor for vulnerabilities
7. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
8. **Logging**: Log security events but don't log sensitive data

#### For Deployment
1. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
2. **Security Headers**: Implement appropriate security headers
3. **Database Security**: Use least privilege principles for database access
4. **Environment Separation**: Keep development and production environments separate
5. **Backup Security**: Secure backup files and database dumps
6. **Monitoring**: Implement security monitoring and alerting

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Security Testing
- **Dependency scanning**: Monitor for vulnerable dependencies
- **Static analysis**: Use tools to scan for security vulnerabilities
- **Dynamic testing**: Implement security testing in CI/CD pipeline

### Manual Security Testing
- **Code reviews**: Include security considerations in code reviews
- **Penetration testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Vulnerability assessments**: Periodic security audits
