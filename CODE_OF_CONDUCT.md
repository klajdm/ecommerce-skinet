# Code of Conduct

## ü§ù Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## üìã Our Standards

### ‚úÖ Positive Behaviors
- **Demonstrating empathy and kindness** toward other people
- **Being respectful** of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- **Giving and gracefully accepting** constructive feedback
- **Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- **Focusing on what is best** not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
- **Using welcoming and inclusive language**
- **Being patient** with newcomers and those learning
- **Offering help** and support to community members

### ‚ùå Unacceptable Behaviors
Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- **Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments**, and personal or political attacks
- **Public or private harassment**
- **Publishing others' private information**, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- **Other conduct** which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- **Dismissing or attacking** inclusion-oriented requests
- **Sustained disruption** of community discussions

## üõ°Ô∏è Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## üåç Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to behavior outside the community spaces when the Project Stewards have a reasonable belief that an individual's behavior may have a negative impact on the community or its members.

## üìû Reporting Guidelines

### How to Report
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at **[klajdi.murataj@gmail.com]** (replace with actual email).

### What to Include
When reporting, please include:

- **Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms)** of any individuals involved
- **Your account** of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing
- **The date and time** of the incident
- **Where the incident occurred** (GitHub issue, PR, email, etc.)
- **Any additional context** you believe would be helpful

### Confidentiality
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Enforcement

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.

### 3. ‚è∏Ô∏è Temporary Ban

Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## üîÑ Appeals Process
